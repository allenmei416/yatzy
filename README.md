## How To Use

As described in the assignment document, Yatzy is a dice game that requires the player to spin 5 dice up to 3 times per turn. On our website, you can roll the dice, and you will see the 5 dice, as well as which turn you're on. The dice can be selected and de-selected in order to keep them for the next turn. After each roll of the dice, you can select on of the dice combinations by clicking on the box, which will be highlighted in green. Aferwards, re-roll the dice until there are no more boxes. After the last box is used, a window will popup with the final score. The game can be restarded with the "Reset Game" button.
